									<h2>Adam Fulton</h2>
									<p>A short biography on Adam's Journey with LCHAD</p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>
									One day when I was about 6 months old my parents discovered 
									I was unresponsive and so weak I could not hold up my own head. 
									I was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with LCHAD. 
									I believe that as a kid growing up as a kid with LCHAD was 
									much harder on my parents than it was for me. I did my 
									best to be a normal kid doing everything that I really 
									wanted to do just like other non-LCHAD kids. I loved to play 
									games at recess, swam on a local swim team, acted in musicals, 
									and my reading level and standardized testing scores were 
									always high. I was able to travel to different locations all 
									around the world for up to a month at a time, some for leisure 
									and some for medical studies for my eyes, heart, and metabolism. 
									My success had much to do with my wonderful and extremely caring 
									parents who always kept a close eye on my diet and activity level 
									until I reached the age where I could do this myself (they still 
									worry about me a little too much if you ask me.) As a child I 
									did not really understand much about LCHAD and so I did not let 
									it slow me down but, often that meant one or two annual trips to 
									the hospital. 
									<br><br>
									While my frequent hospitalizations were not pleasant, they were 
									reminders that I was not an average kid. My parents always made 
									sure my teachers knew about my condition. After answering my 
									peers repetitive inquiries about, “what is that stuff you are 
									drinking at lunch?” and “why do you carry a gatorade around at 
									recess.” it became a normal routine for me to explain that I had 
									LCHAD. The main difference living with LCHAD was a lack of coordination. 
									As such, I did not achieve the success at sports that my older 
									brothers did. I often preferred to sit home and watch TV and as a 
									result I was pretty overweight. However, during puberty I lost much 
									of the weight and with carful diet and exercise I maintain a healthy 
									weight. Once I matured into my teens I started to understand much 
									more about LCHAD and how it affected me I managed to stay out of 
									the hospital for over a decade with self treatment of sugars and 
									carbohydrates.
									<br><br>
									Now that I am older I lead a very normal life. I had a very enjoyable
									high school experience at Bellarmine College Prep and West Valley
									Community College in San Jose. The greatest challenge of my adult life
									was going off to college. I chose a school that was close to home so
									that I could feel free, but safe in case I needed support. I attended
									the Baskin School of engineering at the University of California, Santa
									Cruz. It was the first time I had lived out of the house and to make
									matters more difficult, Santa Cruz built in a forest on a steep hill) is
									a challenging school to navigate on foot for someone with LCHAD.
									Studying late meant meals were often difficult to plan out. I also came
									down with a stomach issue unrelated to LCHAD and the combination of poor
									diet and this stomach issue I had to be hospitalized after over 10
									years. I continued to visit the hospital a few times over the next three
									years and affected me to the point that I had to drop my computer
									engineering minor in order to graduate on time. But, in 2015 I graduated
									from UCSC with a degree in Bioengineering.
									<br><br>
									I now work as a test driver on the Google self-driving car
									project. I plan on going back to school for a masters degree when my
									contract is up in a few years. As I get older I find my main problem
									is an increased rate of muscle atrophy. I have maintain a regiment of
									exercise so I can keep pace with others when doing more strenuous
									exercise such as going on hikes or going doing driving events with my
									father and two brothers which is my main hobby. I have had a very
									full and interesting life and it is hard to say what it would have
									been like if I was born without LCHAD. It has certainly shaped who I
									am and I’m not sure I would ever want to change that despite all of
									the challenges I have had to overcome and will face in the future.
									<br><br>
									I hope this brief biography informs other LCHADers and their parents
									that it is a manageable condition. Though it may seem scary and daunting
									I remind myself everyday that there are many worse inflictions to suffer
									from. You (or you child) can live a very healthy and happy existence.
									The FOD community is abundant and extremely helpful with many incredible
									parents and well qualified doctors who go above and beyond to help
									others. I hope that with new medical advances in treatments that your
									journeys will be fraught with less challenges than me. Please feel free
									to reach out to me or my mother with any questions you may
									have.
