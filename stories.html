									<h2>LCHAD "Attacks"</h2>
									<p>Information on when Adam's body is in distress due to LCHAD</p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>
									When Adam has an LCHAD attack his metabolism is out of balance. His body
									is in need of energy sources to perform the voluntary and involuntary
									activities that keep his body functioning. Normally, short-term energy
									needs are taken care of by eating carbohydrates. When the body is in a
									state of continuous physical activity it will use these short- term
									energy sources (carbohydrates) first to give the body energy. After all
									the carbohydrates are used up, the body then moves on to fat, and will
									breakdown the fats in our body for energy. However, patients with LCHAD
									lack the enzyme used to break down fats. If LCHAD patient’s
									carbohydrates become depleted due to excessive activity or unusual
									stress on the body, the bodies first instinct will be to use fats to
									break them down energy, but since they are lacking the enzyme to convert
									the fats to energy, the body produces a toxic by product instead of
									energy. Next, the bodies will then move to the muscle, and break down
									muscle for sources of energy. The extreme case of this metabolic crisis
									is called Myoglobinurua. There are several reasons why Adam develops
									Myoglobinuria; a slight viral infection, bacterial infection, excessive
									exercise, long fasting periods, and dehydration. Unfortunately, Adam has
									suffered many of these attacks, which results in hospital stays for 2-6
									days. During this time, he is given an IV solution of 10% dextrose at
									over 100 ml/hr to re-hydrate his system and protect his kidneys from the
									effects of Myoglobinurea. As a young child, Adam would complain of
									“hurty legs”, and this was an indication that he was on the verge of an
									attack. This is a severe aching in his legs that usually begins in his
									calves and works quickly up to his thighs and other parts of his body.
									The severity of the pain doesn't always lead to hospitalization. Once,
									we spent about one hour on a brisk sunny afternoon at the ocean soon
									proceeded by about a one-hour visit with a friend. After the visit we
									proceeded to go eat, and as we were sitting down to eat, Adam began
									complaining of leg pain. The pain moved to his arms, neck, and chest. He
									complained it hurt to breathe or talk. Even after having fluids at our
									dinner, we took him to the car where we continued to hydrate him with
									sugar fluids and water. He was able to overcome the incident without
									hospitalization!
									<br><br>
									We are quite frustrated by these sometimes seemingly
									random LCHAD attacks. Sometimes when we expect them, they don't occur,
									and other times out of the blue he gets sick. This is very difficult for
									us and even though we try to monitor his activities, sometimes all of
									our attentiveness fails. Over the years Adam has learned how to hydrate
									and fuel himself before strenuous or long events, in order to prevent
									these attacks. However, even now at the age of 25 he still has attacks
									our main concern is the long-term effects of frequent breakdown of
									muscle tissue in Adam's body.

									<h2>Adam's 2016 Update</h2>
									<p>Adam's life at age 25</p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>
									Adam graduated from the University
									of California at Santa Cruz with a
									BS in Bioengineering. He relaxed for
									about one year casually searching
									for a position in his field.
									Although there are many Biotech
									companies in the San Francisco Bay
									Area most jobs require at least a
									Masters or even a Doctorate degree
									to qualify. Adam did qualify for a
									position at a Biotech company where
									he worked for a while but it proved
									to be just making phone calls to
									clients. It was very unfulfilling
									and he left there after about 5
									months. His present position is more
									in the field of Mechanical
									Engineering. He is a test driver of
									Google’s Driverless Car division.
									This is a interesting job not in his
									major, but he really likes the work
									and enjoys all the perks that Google
									offers.
									<br><br>
									Adam still loves to drive
									his car and participates in
									autocross and track days with his
									dad and brothers. Some Sundays he
									drives on windy challenging roads to
									a mountain restaurant for lunch. At
									home he is still an active video
									gamer. Whenever I see the games he’s
									playing I am amazed by how realistic
									the graphics are. He still sees some
									of his school friends on weekends to
									hang out.

									<h2>Adam's 2014 Update</h2>
									<p>Adam's life at age 23</p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>
									Adam finished his senior year at high school, graduated, and attended
									West Valley community College for 3 years before transferring to the
									University of California at Santa Cruz, where he is now a junior
									majoring in Bioengineering. It is a very difficult major and we are so
									proud of what he has achieved so far. Because of his health issues he
									will probably take 5 years to graduate.
									<br><br>
									Last year, his first at UCSC, he lived in the dorm. We thought this
									would be a big challenge for him to stay healthy and eat properly along
									with the demands of his major and dorm life. He did well having a great
									supportive roommate. 
									<br><br>
									Unfortunately, Adam has had 3 hospitalizations since starting college.
									They were mostly due to letting himself get into a fasting state, not
									getting enough sleep, and drinking alcohol. Of course he knows that
									alcohol inhibits fat metabolism, therefore depleting his energy sources
									more quickly but at his age, reason isn’t always in the forefront of his
									thinking. He has though learned from the severity of the last two
									hospitalizations, in September and October of this year, that he really
									can’t drink anymore. 
									<br><br>
									Usually one beer or a glass of wine will be ok but occasionally it will
									put him over the edge and he must be hospitalized. Fortunately UCSC is
									only about a 45-minute drive from our home.We have been able to go pick
									him up there and drive him back to San Jose and Kaiser Hospital, as
									there are no Kaisers in Santa Cruz.
									<br><br>
									Hospitalizations at his age are pretty scary. And as of January 2, he’s
									in the hospital again! He just doesn’t bounce back as quickly as he did
									when he was younger. During the first of the 3 recent hospitalizations
									it took days before his CK levels started to go down and the usual
									hospitalization time seems to be 5 or more days. Hospitalization #2 he
									was released too soon and had to return late evening of his release
									date. Besides his slow recovery time, we must still stay with him as
									much of the time as possible. We don’t sleep overnight in the room as we
									did when he was younger but need to be in his room to advocate for him
									and make sure he is receiving the right treatment. His metabolic doctor
									is WONDERFUL. We call him on his cell when Adam is going to the hospital
									and he calls the ER and gets things rolling, cluing in the ER doctors
									and alerting them about his symptoms and treatment. However, even with
									this any time of day or night direct communication with his doctor
									(usually via text) on site, still mistakes are made. Since the hospital
									staff hasn’t ever treated an LCHAD patient, they really have no clue as
									to his treatment. Usually D-10 is administered too slowly or at too slow
									a drip rate. Or in September by mistake they took him off his IV drip
									for 6 hours. My husband is usually the wonderful parent who stays with
									Adam and finds follows his treatment.
									<br><br>
									When Adam is in a severe LCHAD Episode now, he for the most part loses
									his ability to talk clearly. He thinks it’s might be weak larynx muscles
									due to his continuous vomiting. He can’t annunciate, and he becomes very
									difficult to understand. That’s why a parent advocate must be present as
									much time as possible. Adam's metabollic doctor is in another city 2+
									hours away so he can’t visit and just keeps up with test results on line
									and talks to the on call doctor. Don is now 69 and I turned 67 this
									week. I don’t know how many more years we can stay with Adam in the
									hospital.
									<br><br>
									Adam’s eyes are worse. Every LCHAD episode affects them more. He still
									drives a car well, even at night. And he’s still in the monthly
									autocross (individual timed driving between cones in a parking lot) and
									occasional Track Days (driving around a professional race track with a
									group of similar cars at the fastest speed that is safe for each
									individual), but when he studies, he must have all the lights on at
									their brightest. A sad note he can’t see stars in the night sky. It just
									looks black. This is especially sad because his older brother is an
									Astronomer and now in the doctorate program at the University of Hawaii.
									One astronomer in the family, and one who can’t even see the stars!
									<br><br>
									We hope Adam will continue for the most part to do well. Now that his
									age is closer to 25 years when hopefully the adult brain is fully
									developed, he will continue to make more good decisions. He does take
									his 1T of MCT Oil and 1t Carnitine in a 6 oz glass of fat free milk at
									least 3 times a day. He also drinks Gatorade when he knows he will be
									stressed mentally or physically. He also eats an occasional NUGO protein
									bar (nugonutrition.com), which has 11 grams of protein.
									<br><br>
									Adam’s present hospitalization is the same ole, same ole. He had severe
									stomach pains that led to vomiting continuously, dehydration, and an
									inability to eat anything by mouth. He’s put on several pain meds once
									in the hospital for the pain. He had a CT Scan that didn’t show any
									abnormalities in his stomach. We’re beginning to wonder if he’s
									developed a food allergy. He will probably need further testing to see
									if this is the case.

									<h2>Adam's 2008 Update</h2>
									<p>Adam's life at age 16</p>
								</header>
								<text>
									<p>
									The big event for Adam, once he turned 16, was getting his Driver’s
									License. It gives him the independence to drive himself to and from his
									high school and to our swim club and other nearby places. It’s a huge
									relief for mom and dad, who don’t need to do as much chauffeuring!
									<br><br>
									Adam is now beginning his junior year at an all boys very competitive
									Jesuit high school. The first two years, for the most part, he thought
									his classes were easy. Adam is still on a summer cabana swim team that
									meets May through July. Like most teens in his age group of 15-18 year
									olds, he rarely goes to the 1 ½ hour 6:30am practice sessions. When he
									does, he has 1 tablespoon MCT Oil and 1 teaspoon of Carnitine mixed in 6
									ounces of fat free milk before and after he swims. He doesn’t have the
									endurance to swim for more than 30 minutes of the practice. It is pretty
									embarrassing for him now because he’s the slowest on the team in his age
									group. But his friends are wonderful and never criticize him for being
									slow. He loves the socialization of just hanging out with the team.
									<br><br>
									For most of the year, Adam is pretty inactive. His nutritionist and
									metabolic doctors would like him to be more active, maybe riding a
									bicycle or going to the gym on a regular basis. This would strengthen
									his muscles and give him some reserve should he have an LCHAD Episode.
									Perhaps I need to explain an LCHAD Episode. This is when he starts
									feeling severe pain in his limbs, particularly in his legs. This is
									caused by a breakdown of his muscles as they try to provide his body
									with energy when his sources of the small amount of fat he can
									metabolize and carbs are depleted. Of course muscles don’t give him
									energy, so they break down (Rhabdomolsis). The broken down muscles leave
									the body through the urine (Myoglobinuria). When he was younger, Adam
									usually had to go to the hospital for an IV when this happened. Since
									the age of 13, he’s been able to overcome LCHAD Episodes with just
									drinking massive amounts of Gatorade.
									<br><br>
									Since he was initially diagnosed with LCHAD at 6 months of age, Adam is
									seen every 6 months at the regional metabolic clinic. There he meets
									with a psychologist, his nutritionist, his metabolic doctor, and others.
									He completes blood work and a diet record before going so that the staff
									can analyze his metabolic control. After the appointments, the metabolic
									staff meets in a group and discusses their patients, sharing information
									between them that will help others. Since Adam’s health plan has a lot
									of members, in Northern California, there are actually two other LCHAD
									kids seen at the same metabolic clinic.
									<br><br>
									Adam has been in two additional studies since I last updated. He was in
									a two-week diet study at Oregon Health and Science University in
									Portland, Oregon. There he stayed in the hospital for 2 weeks, having
									blood work done and stress tests while eating a high carb diet one week
									and a higher protein diet the next. There is a tendency in LCHAD
									deficient individuals to become obese, which can lead to Diabetes 2.
									Being overweight isn’t healthy for anyone but for the LCHAD person it is
									worse. With Diabetes they would have to limit carb intake (which turns
									to sugars). For LCHAD deficient patients, carbs are a MAJOR source of
									energy. If they got Diabetes 2, their main energy source would be
									compromised. LCHAD kids are always told to eat carbs for energy. Adam
									LOVES rice. Unfortunately too many carbs can easily make a person fat.
									He was very overweight at age 9 – 12 years, until puberty. He was always
									told he could NOT diet because it would be toxic to him to lessen
									calories. But at puberty he lost 17 pounds without dieting.
									<br><br>
									The study at OHSU determined that there is less of a tendency for LCHAD
									people to become obese if they decrease carbs for energy and increase
									protein (the low fat type). This summer Adam entered a follow up study
									related to the first. There are around 14 LCHAD participants who make an
									initial 4 day visit to OHSU for base line blood work, stress testing,
									and an MRS fat scan. They are then sent home and told either to continue
									on their usual high carb diet, or to be on a higher protein diet. After
									4 months, they will return to OHSU for more blood work, stress testing,
									and an MRS fat scan to see the results. Ideally, the researchers want to
									find that those on the higher protein diet will have more energy and
									less fat. Adam is in the carb group so he is continuing his usual diet.
									<br><br>
									We have been very fortunate through the years to keep in touch with many
									LCHAD families around the world. We met families in Sweden and Germany
									in 2002. This summer we again met Jane Carroll, our initial LCHAD
									friend. She has always been in better metabolic control than most LCHAD
									individuals. At age 14 she ice skates competitively and has no retinal
									deterioration. Some of this may be attributed to her having a G tube
									until age 13 and having a very carefully monitored diet. We are now
									beginning to look for a university for Adam. I’ll try to update when
									he’s in college!
